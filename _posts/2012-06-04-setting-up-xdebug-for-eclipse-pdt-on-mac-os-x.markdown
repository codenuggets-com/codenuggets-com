In the <a href="http://codenuggets.com/2012/02/16/setting-up-php-development-environment-using-eclipse-pdt-and-zend-server-ce/">previous post</a>, I outline the steps to configure Zend Debugger debugging PHP application in Eclipse PDT. Unfortunately past couple of weeks I had problem making the debugger to break execution on my break points. I believe part of the problem is the complexity of the Zend debugger and that it's misconfigured. I decided to give another popular debugger for PHP a try: <a href="http://xdebug.org/">Xdebug</a>.

I followed this article to set up Xdebug for Eclipse PDT on Mac OS X: <a href="http://nali.org/mac-os-x-eclipse-pdt-mamp-xdebug-fun/">Mac OS X + Eclipse + PDT + MAMP + Xdebug Fun</a>
