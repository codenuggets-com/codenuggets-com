Steps to setup a dedicated TF2 server on Windows 7 machine.

1. Install Steam client: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/about/">http://store.steampowered.com/about/</a>. See note 1 below.
2. Install Server Installer hldsupdatetool.exe which can be installed from Â <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/download/hldsupdatetool.exe" target="_blank">http://www.steampowered.com/download/hldsupdatetool.exe</a>
    - The server doesn't need the game installed. hldsupdatetool.exe will install everything needed.
3. Install hldsupdatetool.exe. I installed to C:\Users\Jeff\Applications\HLServer
4. Run hldsupdatetool.exe to install TF2 server in a <em>different</em>directory. `hldsupdatetool -command update -game tf -dir C:\Users\Jeff\Applications\TF2Server`
    
    This is about 5 GB in size so take a while

5. Create and edit `TF2Server\orangebox\tf\cfg\server.cfg`. See cfg file below
6. Run `TF2Server\orangebox\srcds.exe`: `srcds.exe -console -game tf -hostport 27015 +maxplayers 24 +map ctf_2fort`


Note 1: Initially I didn't have Steam client install and I get the message: <a href="http://www.facepunch.com/threads/961459">http://www.facepunch.com/threads/961459</a>. After installing Steam client, the problem is solved.
