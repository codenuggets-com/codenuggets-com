Apparently arrays in PHP are passed by value, not by reference as you would intuitively think. To illustrate, consider the following snippet of PHP code:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$a = array(1, 2, 3);
$b = $a;             //This actually creates a copy
$b[1] = 3;           //This does not affect $a
var_dump($a);
var_dump($b);
?>
{% endhighlight %}

When `$b` is assigned `$a`, PHP actually first creates a copy of the array `$a`, then assign the new array to `$b`. Essentially when `$b` is modified, `$a` is unaffected. The output of the code above follows:

{% highlight php %}
array(3) { [0] => int(1) [1] => int(2) [2] => int(3) }
array(3) { [0] => int(1) [1] => int(3) [2] => int(3) }
{% endhighlight %}

I learned this the hard way and spent too much time figuring out what was wrong with my code.

Interesting and confusing enough, class instance objects are passed by reference.
