I am working on a web application using PHP and Yii. I was looking for some user interface components and I found jQuery EasyUI, <a href="http://www.jeasyui.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.jeasyui.com/index.php</a>. Even though I did not use these components in my project this time, they look really nice and I plan to take a closer look in the future.
