I created a game, Four Letter Word, from a course assignment. The game can be found at <a href="http://codenuggets.com/four-letter-word" target="_blank">http://codenuggets.com/four-letter-word</a>. It looks like a normal word guessing game, but under the hood, it tries to dodge your guesses and reports the guesses are wrong as much as it can without revealing this fact and making the game predictable.

The game is written in jQuery. Can you guess the four letter word?
