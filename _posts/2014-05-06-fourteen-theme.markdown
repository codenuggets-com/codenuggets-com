It's the end of Spring 2014 semester and I no longer have to teach students on Tuesday and Thursday. Recently I've been getting back to working on the theme design, called Fourteen, I started a few months ago that I noted in the <a href="http://codenuggets.com/2014/03/18/new-theme/">previous post</a>. Though still a work-in-progress, it is finally at a point where I can use it. I applied the theme to my blog tonight and what you're looking at is the fruit of labors (and love).

For this theme, I am aiming for the minamalist design. I started this project from the official TwentyFourteen theme and removed a lot of visual elements to make it clean and streamlined; thus the name Fourteen (shorter version of TwentyFourteen).

To make this theme, I spent a lot of time learning WordPress internals and CSS. The books I used as references as I develop this themes are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111844227X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=111844227X&linkCode=as2&tag=codenugg-20&linkId=LEN6ZAUGQ4H5JWJM" target="_blank">Professional WordPress: Design and Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449325947/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449325947&linkCode=as2&tag=codenugg-20&linkId=4SJFJ6UIA7CED36T" target="_blank">CSS3: The Missing Manual</a>.

Overall I'm pleased with the simplicity of the theme. The code of this theme is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/wangchj/fourteen" target="_blank">https://github.com/wangchj/fourteen</a>
