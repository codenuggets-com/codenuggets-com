  content: Greetings from California! I'm bored to death at work and so i decided
    to check out your internet site on my iphone during lunch break. I love the data
    you present right here and can't hold out to take a look when I get home. I'm
    shocked at how quick your blog loaded on my phone, I'm not really even using WIFI,
    just 3G. Anyways, wonderful site!

This environment is intended for my spatial RDF store project. The underlying triple store (rdf3xquery) runs on Ubuntu, and my spatial integration are written in C#.

The obvious choice to develop in C# on Ubuntu is to use Mono Framework and <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a>. Mono is a cross-platform implementation of the CLI and .NET Framework, and MonDevelop is an IDE designed to use Mono Framework. I check MonoDevelop's website for binary to install, but it appears the binary for Ubuntu is maintained by <a href="http://badgerports.org/">http://badgerports.org/</a>. The following are the steps.

<u>Update</u> (3/31/2012): as of Ubuntu 12.04, MonoDevelop 2.8.3 is included in the official software repository; therefore, there is no need to add badgerport repository.

**Step 1**: Make sure Mono is install, as described <a href="http://codenuggets.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=150&action=edit&message=1"> here</a>

**Step 2**: Add Repository URL

1. Click on "System", "Administration", "Software Sources".
2. Click on the "Other Software" tab.
3. Click on "Add...", and enter the line: `deb http://badgerports.org lucid main`

**Step 3**: Install MonoDevelop in Software Center

The version of Ubuntu I use in this post is 10.04 (LTS), the version of Mono is 2.10.8.1-1, and MonoDevelop is 2.8.6.3+dfsg-2~dhx1~lucid1.
