My friend is moving out of his apt tomorrow to go back to Taiwan. We've talked before about if he decided not to ship his digital piano back, then I'd buy it for $200. Yesterday he decided that it costs too much for the shipping so today I bought his digital piano.

The piano include the follow:

- Digital Piano
- Stand
- Power cord
- Pedal
- USB recording cable
- Earphone
- Manual
- Bag

In addition my friend also gave me the following he thinks he cannot take:

- Piano stool
- Pedal he bought
