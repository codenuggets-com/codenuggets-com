Today I auditioned with the worship band of The Church of Highlands Auburn. Met a few people in the practice group (the Infuse). I never actually played with a full band with drums, keyboard, electric, guitar, base. They also have so many sound equipment. I was definitely nervous, and the earpiece that goes into one piece of their equipment (the Aviom) keeps falling off.

The songs of the audition follows:<br />
1. Our God Reign, Place of Freedom, Highlands Worship<br />
2. Cornerstone, Hillsong Live, EMI Christian Music Group. I love this song.

I may post the chords later.
