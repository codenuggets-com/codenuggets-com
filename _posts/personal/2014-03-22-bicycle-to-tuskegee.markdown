Today I and friends rode our bicycle from Auburn to Tuskegee and back. We started out around 9 am at Shelby Center and departed soon after. Howard and Kang have rented their gears, very nice road bikes and helmets, from the Outdoor Center of Auburn University Recreational Center. Zhitao rented a mountain bike from the same place. I rode my own mountain bike.

The way there was interested. There were easy bike lanes before Kiesel Park. After that point, it was all riding on the road. We stopped several times, reached Tuskegee around 1:30, and had lunch.

We started our return trip around 3pm and reached 6pm.
