During the past couple of weeks, I have been trying out rock climbing at the new student recreational center at Auburn. I really enjoy the activity so far and it is a really good workout for the arms, especially the forearm. I also never have so many scrapes and bruises on my knee in my life.

There are two kinds of belay (fall-stop) system at the recreational center, both top belay. The first is the auto-belay (the yellow), and the other which require another person to belay you. The none-auto-belay system definitely requires a bit of trust on the belayer.

Yesterday I took the class that introduce rock climbing. The taught us how to tie the knots and how to be a belayer.

Today I pass the verification, which tests if you can be a belayer. I took the verification the first time and I pass; so now I can belay other people.
