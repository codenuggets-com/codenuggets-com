Today is the first Sunday I volunteer in the Video and Sound Production Team at the Church of Highlands. I woke up around 5:30 am and arrived at church at 6 am. A few team members showed me how to set up and videos and lyrics for the day's service and get ready for the band rehearsal at 6 am.

I did the lyrics for 3 services today: 8 am, 9:30 am, 11:30 am (total of 7 hours).
