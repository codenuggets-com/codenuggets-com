After coming back from Taiwan trip, I have been unpacking then packing again for the move. I officially moved out of Magnolia Studios (G-5) today. I'm currently staying in Montgomery until the new apartment in Auburn is ready for moving in next week. I've live in MS for more than 2 years, since January of 2012.
