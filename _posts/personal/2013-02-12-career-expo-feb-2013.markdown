I went to a Career Expo today at Auburn University Hotel. I truly enjoyed talking to recruiters of different companies and learn about the projects they are working on and also got some interesting souvenirs LOL.

Stupidly I only printed out 9 copies of my resume and at the end, I kind of ran our resume. The following are the companies and organizations I talked to today.

0. **WebFilings**: the first representative I talked to. I'm not sure I talked to them except that I just arrived and a little disoriented. They do web-based business application possibly utilizing Google App Enigne.
0. **Adtran**: they hire software engineer for embedded software for their equipment (routers, etc) and also test engineers. I got a earphone from them LOL 
0. **Delaware Consulting**: They do SharePoint design for different organizations. They have a little game of guess how many jellybeans in a jar (funny!).
0. **AT&T**: they have internship positions national, but they are from the Atlanta office.
0. **TVA**: Tennessee Valley Authority. I think everyone knows what they do. They are a government electricity management organization.
0. **American Buildings**: they do visualization and design software for building construction.
0. **Bently Systems**: they are just like Intergraph. They gave me a bag
0. **Metova**: they develop mobile software on various platforms (iPhone, Android, Web). This really seems to be an interesting company. I got a whole bag of different things: a bag of chips, a bottle water, and a coozie
0. **NASA**: they told me I am the only one they have talked at the time to have a specific qualification: PhD student with 4.0 GPA YES!!! They gave me some info about federal jobs. I got a NASA sticker and pin.
