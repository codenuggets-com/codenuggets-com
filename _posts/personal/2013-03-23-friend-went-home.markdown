I guess college is like this: there are always people coming and leaving. I remember last time my friend went home. Once again, a friend went home today, a bitter sweet moment. I wish her safe journey home and have a wonderful new beginning in Taiwan!

Another two of my friends left Auburn today. They will take a trip around southeast before going back to Taiwan. Wish them a fun and relaxing trip and a safe trip back home.
