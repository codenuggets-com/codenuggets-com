Today's pretty interesting: I attended the new graduate teaching assistant (GTA) orientation. Since I started graduate school here at Auburn, I've been working as GRA and the coming Fall semester will be my first semester working as GTA, and this is the first time I attend the GTA orientation.

Since moving back to Montgomery as mentioned in the <a href="http://codenuggets.com/2012/08/04/moved-out-of-magnolia-studios/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I haven't moved back to Auburn. However I returned to Auburn today to attend the orientation. The orientation started at 12pm for the signing up and registration and talking to some people. At 1pm is plenary presentations, in which issues of academic honesty, studentÂ accommodations, etc where presented. After the presentation, I attended GTA 101 and GTA 102 sessions. Both were interesting, and provided information for making classes interesting. In GTA 101 we played Einstein's puzzle, which I thought was interesting.
