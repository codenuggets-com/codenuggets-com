Blowin' In The Wind  
Original Lyrics by Bob Dylan  
In key of C

```
C        F            C
How many roads must a man walk down
           F          G
Before you call him a man ?
C        F           C
How many seas must a white dove sail
           F             G
Before she sleeps in the sand ?
C        F              C
How many times must the cannon balls fly
               F       G
Before they're forever banned ?
[To Chorus]


[Chorus]
    F         G         C              Am
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
    F         G              C
The answer is blowin' in the wind.


C        F           C
How many years can a mountain exist
            F             G
Before it's washed to the sea ?
C        F              C
How many years can some people exist
               F             G
Before they're allowed to be free ?
C        F           C
How many times can a man turn his head
                   F            G
Pretending that he just doesn't see ?
[To Chorus]


C        F            C
How many times must a man look up
          F               G
Before he really sees the sky ?
C        F         C
How many ears must one man have
              F           G
Before he can hear people cry ?
C        F              C
How many deaths will it take till he knows
              F           G
That too many people have died ?
[To Chorus]
