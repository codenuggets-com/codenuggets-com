excerpt: "After 3 years running Ubunt 10.04, today I finally updated the Ubuntu machine
  in my office (ilab-ubuntu) to the latest release 13.04.\r\n\r\nOne of the reason
  I upgrade is to support my projects. The software on this machine is getting dated
  and I want to upgrade my PHP to support phpUnit.\r\n\r\nI also installed Cinnamon
  to replace Unity desktop environment. I installed Cinnamon through the Ubuntu Software
  Center. The version I find here is cinnamon 1.7.4-1, but the latest version I see
  on Cinnamon website is Cinnamon 1.6.7, Nemo 1.1.2. Does anyone know why?\r\n\r\n"

After 3 years running Ubunt 10.04, today I finally updated the Ubuntu machine in my office (ilab-ubuntu) to the latest release 13.04.

One of the reason I upgrade is to support my projects. The software on this machine is getting dated and I want to upgrade my PHP to support phpUnit.

I also installed Cinnamon to replace Unity desktop environment. I installed Cinnamon through the Ubuntu Software Center. The version I find here is cinnamon 1.7.4-1, but the latest version I see on Cinnamon website is Cinnamon 1.6.7, Nemo 1.1.2. Does anyone know why?
