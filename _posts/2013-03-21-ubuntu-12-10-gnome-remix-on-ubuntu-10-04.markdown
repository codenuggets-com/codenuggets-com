Today I install Ubuntu 12.10 Gnome Remix using VirtualBox 4.2.10 on my Ubuntu 10.04. The result was surprisingly good. I've recently try to install Ubuntu 12.10 with Unity and the performance was horrible. The performance of Ubuntu 12.10 with Gnome on virtual machine is not bad

One note is that, don't install the guest additions for this configuration. I thought installing it would boost performance, but I was wrong. After installing the guest additions, the performance became so bad, I decided to reinstall.
